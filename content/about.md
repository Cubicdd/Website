Victoria Engineering Club is a group of Victoria University students who share a common interest in engineering and technology. We host events involving gaming, software and electronic challenges, and connections with notable members of the engineering and technology industry.


Our goal is to enrich studentsâ€™ university experience by providing opportunities to connect with the New Zealand tech industry, develop skills, and engage in fun social activities.
