Welcome to our first Victoria Engineering Club newsletter for the year! Hopefully you’re all settling into your classes well. Here at VEC we’ve been working hard to get the club back up and running, sorting out events for the year, dealing with all the boring bureaucracy and much more.

First, I’d like to give a brief introduction to each of our sub-clubs, as we’ll be working along-side them to improve your club experience.

## Sub-clubs
### VSEC
The Victoria SEcurity Club is here to bring you a place for students to hangout and work together on exploring the world of security. They plan to run a number of workshops, Capture the Flags (CTF’s), industry events, and bring our students to national competitions. Even if you’ve never done anything like this, they’d love to see new faces!

### VRAM
Victoria Robotics and Mechatronics is busy planning for when we are safe to run in person events. These events will include workshops to teach students how to model, program and polish robots to prepare for competitions such as VEXU. Targeting both beginners and experts, it’ll be a great time to try out the intersection of hardware and software.

### GDSC
The Google Development Student Club is a worldwide program which is establishing peer-to-peer learning environments at universities around the globe. They will be bringing a mix of events for you to explore new technologies (like Android and Firebase) as well as meet other students with whom you can collaborate and share ideas. Practice sessions for coding competitions are also in the works, so keep an eye out for those!

### VISDA
The Victoria Information Systems and Data Analytics society is designed to introduce students to a variety of unique opportunities to expand their skill set, improve connections with alumni/employers, and assist in industry preparation. There are plans in the works for guest speakers and hopefully some new competitions for their members to compete in.

## EVENTS
As for our upcoming events, here are just a few of our planned events!

### Game Jam
We’ll be running a game jam where you have a week to create a game centered around a random theme. We’ll have an online workshop and a few judges from the university, so start getting familiar with game development. We’d recommend Processing if it’s your first time, however any language is allowed. This is planned for the 5th week of Trimester 1 so add it to your calendar!

### Clubs Expo
Clubs expo has come and gone, we were so happy to see all the people that showed up to have a chat and join the various clubs! If you’ve joined us from there, welcome!

### IGM
Our Inaugural General Meeting is quickly approaching on Tuesday, 8th of March, at 6pm. We’ll be running this via Zoom to keep everyone safe, and will be releasing the Zoom link closer to the date via our social media. We’ll be further discussing our sub-clubs, our events, and you’ll get a chance to meet the executive board.

### Vic CTF
In the near future we’ll be running some cybersecurity Capture the Flag events. While the main event is aimed towards beginners, we’ll also have some harder tasks for more experienced people to join in on the fun. Before it starts, we’ll be running multiple workshops and working with industry to give everyone a bit more understanding of the events. And of course, you can’t forget the prizes up for grabs!

Right, well that’s the end of March’s monthly newsletter, if you’d like to keep up to date with what VEC or the various sub-clubs are working on, events, workshops etc, Check out and give our social media a follow as we post most information there. Until next month: think it, plan it, build it!
